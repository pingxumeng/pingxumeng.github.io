##BIO blocking
When using BufferedReader for inputStream of socket, note that readline method will block until line sep has been reached or client socket close.
the end of the stream has been reached in BufferedReader's javadoc mean that client socket closed in socket situation. See [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6139834/sockets-bufferedreader-readline-blocks](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6139834/sockets-bufferedreader-readline-blocks)

the same to all read operation.。

```java
static void startBlockServer(int port) throws IOException {
    ServerSocket socket = new ServerSocket(port);
    while (true) {
        //accept connection
        Socket client = socket.accept();
        System.out.println("Accepted connection from " + client);
        //input stream reader with buffer.
        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(client.getInputStream()));
        //if use BufferedReader.readLine(), client must send string contains line sep ,
        //else will block until client socket closed.
        //the end of the stream has been reached in javadoc mean that client socket closed.
        //so, readLine will be blocking after reading the last line using while loop , until client socket has been closed.
        OutputStreamWriter writer = new OutputStreamWriter(new BufferedOutputStream(client.getOutputStream()));
        String line;
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) { //readLine will be blocking after reading the last line ,until client socket has been closed.
            System.out.println(line);
            sb.append(line);
        }
        System.out.println("from client:" + sb);
        writer.write("Hello from server");
        writer.flush();
        writer.close();
        reader.close();
        client.close();
    }
}
```

##Blocking IO
server :

```java
static void startBlockServer(int port) throws IOException {
    ServerSocket socket = new ServerSocket(port);
    try{
        while (true) {
            //accept connection
            Socket client = socket.accept();
            System.out.println("Accepted connection from " + client);
            //input stream reader with buffer.
            BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(client.getInputStream()));
            PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(client.getOutputStream());
            writer.println("hello "+ reader.readLine());
            writer.flush();
            writer.close();
            reader.close();
            client.close();
        }
    } finally {
        socket.close();
    }
}
```
When listening a port will block until client connect to.

```java
Socket client = socket.accept();//will block until accepting a connection.
```

the call to `reader.readLine()` blocks until next line was received or the other end socket is closed(disconnect).

client:

```java
private static void connect() {
    try {
        Socket socket = new Socket("127.0.0.1", 8999);
        //real output stream
        OutputStream outputStream = socket.getOutputStream();
        BufferedOutputStream buffer = new BufferedOutputStream(outputStream);
        PrintWriter write = new PrintWriter(buffer , true);
        write.println("simon");
        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));
        String readStr = reader.readLine();
        System.out.println("from server:" + readStr);
        write.close();
        reader.close();
        socket.close();

    } catch (Exception e) {
        System.out.println(e);
    }
}
```


##NON-Blocking server:

```java
static void startNIOServer() throws IOException {
    ServerSocketChannel server = ServerSocketChannel.open();
    Selector selector = Selector.open();
    server.configureBlocking(false);
    SocketAddress address = new InetSocketAddress(8999);
    server.bind(address);
    server.register(selector, SelectionKey.OP_ACCEPT);
    while (true) {
        selector.select();
        Iterator<SelectionKey> iterator = selector.selectedKeys().iterator();
        while (iterator.hasNext()) {
            SelectionKey key = iterator.next();
            iterator.remove();
            if (key.isAcceptable()) {
                SocketChannel socketChannel = server.accept();
                System.out.println("connected from" + socketChannel);
                socketChannel.configureBlocking(false);
                socketChannel.register(selector, SelectionKey.OP_READ);
            } else if (key.isReadable()) {
                SocketChannel socketChannel = (SocketChannel) key.channel();
                ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);
                int readCount;
                socketChannel.read(buffer);
                while ((readCount = socketChannel.read(buffer)) > 0) {
                    buffer.flip();
                    byte[] array = buffer.array();
                    String res = new String(array);
                    System.out.println(res);
                    buffer.clear();
                    buffer.put("hello \n".getBytes());
                    buffer.flip();
                    socketChannel.write(buffer);
                    buffer.clear();
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
NIO is based on two concepts, channels and buffers. Channels are roughly analogous to streams used in the stream model. Buffers do not have a precise analog in the stream model.
The basic streams, InputStream and OutputStream, can read and write bytes; subclasses of these stream classes can read and write other kinds of data. In NIO, all data is read and written via buffers. See Figure 1 for a comparison of the two models.

1. A `Buffer` contains data in a linear sequence for reading or writing. A special buffer provides for memory-mapped file I/O.
2. A `Charset` maps Unicode character strings to and from byte sequences. (Yes,  this is Java's third shot at character conversion.)
3. `Channel`s -- which can be sockets, files, or pipes -- represent a bidirectional communication pipe.
4. `Selector`s multiplex asynchronous I/O operations into one or more threads.


###Channel
Notice that while the stream model distinguishes between InputStreams and OutputStreams, NIO uses one kind of object—a Channel—for both. 
###Buffer
Buffer is bideriction.
###Selector
http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?select+2
only `SelectableChannel` can be regist to selectors.
Reactor allows applications to decouple event arrival from event handling. Events arrive at arbitrary times but are not immediately dispatched. Instead, a Reactor keeps track of the events until the handlers ask for them.

The select facility works differently. With select you register many input streams with a Selector object. When I/O activity happens on any of the streams, the Selector tells you. This way, it's possible to read from a large number of data sources from a single thread. Note also that Selectors don't just help you read data; they can also listen for incoming network connections and write data across slow channels.

As discussed earlier, the select I/O model is essentially event-driven. All of your input sources are registered with a single Selector object, which waits for activity on any of the input sources. This model differs from the stream model, but it's still a solid model. In fact, in the larger scheme of things, it's generally more correct to think of the stream model as a layer that runs on top of the select model. At the hardware level, I/O is fundamentally event-driven, since peripherals such as network cards, keyboards, and some disk drives send their data without warning.
